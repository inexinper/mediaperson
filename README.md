During his career, Cobb came up with the design of a time machine DeLorean DMC-12 from "Back to the Future", the ship "Nostromo" from "Alien" and the scenery "Conan the Barbarian". Among his other works are creatures from "Star Wars" and a colony of earthlings from "Aliens".

His cartoons from the sixties and seventies are collected in several out of print books: RCD-25 (1967) and Mah Fellow Americans (1968) were published by Sawyer Press. Raw Sewage and My Fellow Americans (1971) were published by Price Stern and Sloan.
